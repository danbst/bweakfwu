(tl;dr version:
Design document         = What is in the game
Implementation document = How it works)

The design document (design.txt) details what features the game should have, 
and sometimes why these features are desirable and how they are used. It does 
not dictate *how* the features are implemented; it is implementation-agnostic. 
The technical document (technical.txt) documents *how* these features are 
actually implemented.

This design document will change whenever a feature is introduced or changed. 
If there are any dissimilarities between the design document and the technical 
document, this is a bug. When this happens, always assume the design document 
is correct, and that the technical document needs an update.
